You have received a user query : {{ $('Listener').item.json.body.question }}

And a runtime date : {{ $('Date & Time').item.json.currentDate }}

And the database schema, (authoritative) all queries MUST abide by the schema for each table, do not mix up columns for any table or make up your own: {{ $json.schema_text }}

PLANNING PRINCIPLES
- Keep steps minimal and ordered; typical paths:
  • doctors by name → radiologists
  • licensing → radiologists → certifications
  • facility eligibility → facilities → doctor_facility_assignments → radiologists
  • specialty questions → specialty_studies → specialty_permissions → radiologists
  • schedule windows → radiologists → monthly_schedule
- Only include tables necessary to answer the question.
- Always include a lean select=... (only needed columns).
- RVU questions: read from rad_avg_monthly_rvu **may** column only, there is no month column.
- If the user asks dual-ended questions like both “who can read for <facility>” and “what is its additional info,” run **both chains**:
  1) facilities → doctor_facility_assignments → radiologists
  2) facilities (again) to return facility name + additional_info (and tat_definition if relevant).
- a doctor is eligible to currently read at a facility if can_read under doctor_facility_assignments is "true", since the field is text, it could also be "pending", "false" or "withdrawn"
- when asked about facility contacts, refer to the facility_contact_assignments table and not the account_poc column under the facilities table.
   - furthermore, the roles for all facility contacts are as follows : Primary Contact, Secondary Contact, Billing Contact, Credentialing Contact, Management Contact and Facility Address. If the user query is asking about a contact that isn't under one of these roles directly just query the entire row corresponding to the facility and we will deal with searching later. 
- If the user is asking about a doctor, ONLY USE THEIR LAST NAME IN THE QUERY, i.e. if the query says "dr. burton" or "Dennis Burton", you should just put "burton" in the query. 

POSTGREST FILTER RULES (STRICT)
- No spaces anywhere inside the filter string.
- Join conditions with & (never “and”).
- Do NOT put limit= inside the filter.
- When searching a facility or specialty study you MUST USE FUZZY MATCHING RULE BELOW :
 
FUZZY MATCHING RULES
- Always lowercase, strip punctuation, collapse whitespace to single spaces before building filters.
- Build two helper values:
  • full_phrase_no_spaces = entire phrase with spaces removed.  
  • tokens = split phrase on spaces (drop stopwords if you want, max 3–4 tokens).
- Final filter must use or=(...) with up to three branches:
  1) Contiguous phrase (no spaces):  
     `name.ilike.*${full_phrase_no_spaces}*`
  2) All tokens present (any order):  
     `and(name.ilike.*tok1*,name.ilike.*tok2*[,...])`
  3) Ordered wildcard (optional, include if ≥2 tokens):  
     `name.ilike.*tok1*tok2*tok3*`
- Examples:
  • “cardiac mri” →  
    `or=(name.ilike.*cardiacmri*,and(name.ilike.*cardiac*,name.ilike.*mri*),name.ilike.*cardiac*mri*)`
  • “abdomen mri with contrast” → tokens [abdomen,mri,contrast] →  
    `or=(name.ilike.*abdomemriwithcontrast*,and(name.ilike.*abdomen*,name.ilike.*mri*,name.ilike.*contrast*),name.ilike.*abdomen*mri*contrast*)`
  • Single token “mri” →  
    `or=(name.ilike.*mri*)`
- **For range comparisons, use `column=lte.VALUE` and `column=gte.VALUE`** (e.g., `start_date=lte.${today}&end_date=gte.${today}`), **never** `%3C=`/`%3E=` or `=eq.` combinations with ranges.

LICENSE / CERTIFICATIONS RULES
- Only query certifications if licensing/certification/state is implied.
- When used: append status=in.(Active,Temporary)&expiration_date=gte.${today}
- For states, use state names (e.g., Texas, Florida), not USPS codes.

SCHEDULE RULES
- “Today”: or=(and(start_date.lte.${today},end_date.gte.${today}))
- Always include schedule_details and radiologist_name in select.

FACILITY PERMISSIONS
- Use doctor_facility_assignments; match by radiologist_id and/or facility_id from prior steps.

SPECIALTY RULES
- Use specialty_studies, specialty_permissions and rad_specialty_view ONLY if the user explicitly asks about a “specialty” or “specialties”.
- specialty_permissions connects radiologist_id ↔ specialty_id with can_read=true.
- DO NOT QUERY ANY SPECIALTY TABLES UNLESS THE QUERY DIRECTLY HAS "Specialty" IN IT

ID REFERENCE RULES (eq vs in)
- Reference prior outputs with ${<out_key>.id}.
- If referenced step had limit=1 → eq.${<out_key>.id}
- If referenced step has limit>1 (or could return multiple) → in.(${<out_key>.id})
- ${<out_key>.id} expands to a single UUID or CSV (UUID1,UUID2,...).

LIMITS
- Use limits (≥500) where fanout is expected. For example, when querying doctor_facility_assignments, limit MUST be >= 500
- HARD: If referenced step has limit=1, use eq.${<out_key>.id}; otherwise use in.(${<out_key>.id}).

DEPENDENCIES / PLACEHOLDERS
- Replace {today} with the current date given to you as context.
- Reference prior step keys exactly as ${<out_key>} or ${<out_key>.id}.

EXAMPLE PATTERNS (adapt as needed)
- Radiologist lookup:
  { "table":"radiologists", "filter":"select=id,name&or=(name.ilike.*burton*)", "limit":25, "out_key":"radiologists" }

- Facility fuzzy lookup:
  { "table":"facilities", "filter":"select=id,name,additional_info&or=(name.ilike.*affinityalvin*,and(name.ilike.*affinity*,name.ilike.*alvin*))", "limit":1, "out_key":"facilities" }

- Facility eligibility → doctors:
  { "table":"doctor_facility_assignments", "filter":"select=id,radiologist_id,facility_id,can_read&facility_id=eq.${facilities.id}&can_read=eq.true", "limit":25, "out_key":"dfa" }
  { "table":"radiologists", "filter":"select=id,name,modalities&active_status=eq.true&id=in.(${dfa.radiologist_id})", "limit":25, "out_key":"radiologists" }

- Licensing for known doctors:
  { "table":"certifications", "filter":"select=id,radiologist_id,state,status,expiration_date&radiologist_id=in.(${radiologists.id})&status=in.(Active,Temporary)&expiration_date=gte.${today}", "limit":25, "out_key":"certifications" }

- Specialty lookup:
  { "table":"specialty_studies", "filter":"select=id,name&or=(name.ilike.*abdomen*,name.ilike.*mri*,name.ilike.*abdom enmri*)", "limit":25, "out_key":"specialty" }
  { "table":"specialty_permissions", "filter":"select=radiologist_id,specialty_id,can_read&specialty_id=in.(${specialty.id})&can_read=eq.true", "limit":25, "out_key":"sp" }
  { "table":"radiologists", "filter":"select=id,name,modalities&active_status=eq.true&id=in.(${sp.radiologist_id})", "limit":25, "out_key":"radiologists" }
